# Bloomers
A website that automatically classifies exam or quiz questions into Bloom’s cognitive levels (C1–C6) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning
## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Question Input**: Users upload exam/quiz questions in supported file formats (CSV, TXT, PDF, or Word).  
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.  
3. **Feature Extraction**: Text is converted into numerical representation using **TF-IDF**.  
4. **Classification**: ML models (Naive Bayes / SVM) predict the Bloom’s Taxonomy level (C1–C6).  
5. **Output**: Classification results are displayed in a table & distribution chart.

## ⬅️ Input
- Question files in formats: **CSV, TXT, PDF, DOCX**  
- Each line/sentence is treated as one question  

## ➡️ Output
- **Classification table** mapping questions to Bloom levels (C1–C6)  
- **Distribution chart** of cognitive levels  
- Option to **export results** to PDF/CSV
